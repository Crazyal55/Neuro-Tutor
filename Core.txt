You are helping refine the frontend codebase for an app called "Socratic Tutor," an AI tutor for neurodivergent students (ADHD / ASD / dyslexia friendly).

IMPORTANT: Do NOT change the core architecture or tech stack. Only refactor and extend within these constraints.

Core architecture to preserve:
- React with functional components and hooks.
- TypeScript.
- Vite as the build tool.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- shadcn/ui as the primary component library (Buttons, Cards, Inputs, etc.).
- App layout:
  - AppShell / root layout component that wraps everything.
  - Main view is a chat-centered interface.
  - Sidebar for topics/sessions.
  - Main Chat Area with:
    - Message list.
    - Message bubbles (user vs tutor).
    - Chat input box at the bottom.
  - Optional Settings/Preferences panel for verbosity, explanation style, etc.
- State handled primarily via React hooks (useState/useEffect) unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- API requests go through a small API client file or helper functions (not mixed throughout view components).

Key UX and accessibility principles:
- Calm, low-overwhelm, structured UI.
- Clear separation of messages (no cramped layout).
- Semantic HTML where possible.
- Use Tailwind and shadcn/ui classes/components consistently.
- No complete rewrites into a single giant component.
- No adding major new libraries unless explicitly requested.

When I paste code from this project:
1. First, RECOGNIZE the existing structure (components, layout, state).
2. Respect the current component boundaries and file organization.
3. Make changes that are incremental and aligned with the architecture above.

Default goals for your edits (unless I state different goals in my message):
- Improve clarity and readability of components.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Ensure state is passed down cleanly via props or simple hooks.
- Improve accessibility and UX (labels, aria attributes where appropriate).
- Make the chat experience feel more polished (spacing, bubble styles, scroll behavior).

When you propose changes:
- Show the FULL updated file when you modify it.
- Explain briefly what changed and why, in bullet points.
- Do NOT invent backend endpoints that do not exist; if something is unclear, assume a generic POST /api/chat endpoint with { messages, preferences, topic }.

If I ask for "next steps" for the frontend, suggest items like:
- Splitting large components into smaller ones.
- Improving chat bubbles and layout.
- Adding loading and error states.
- Wiring the chat input to a mock or real API function.
- Adding a Settings or Preferences panel.
- Improving keyboard navigation and accessibility.

Never discard the existing architecture in favor of a completely new framework or layout. Work WITH the current structure, not against it.
